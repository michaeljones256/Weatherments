Hunter 4/23
	We implemented both the streaming api (StreamLoc) to get the tweets and the 
	sentiment analysis (sentiment()) of the tweets.
	We also implemented the data type that stores the info we need (TweetDB) so
	it can be sent to the databse.
	***What we need to do/improve:
		We need to finish the weather api and integrate it (add weatherSents in TweetCollector)
		We need to decide how to limit the streaming api (i.e. when to stop collecting)
		
Hunter 5/3
	We integrated the weather sentiment into our TweetDB object.
	**** Before we deploy and start collecting we have to refine our tweet sentiment analysis to	
			limit the amount of neutrals we get.
